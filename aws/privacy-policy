We don't store your data, period.

We physically can't. We have nowhere to store it. We don't even have a server database to store it. So even if Justin Bieber asked nicely to see your data, we wouldn't have anything to show him.

That's why, with Awa, what happens on your app stays on your app.

We only keep track of the active connection to the app to distribute your message.
